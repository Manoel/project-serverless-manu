# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

This repository demonstrates how to make a simple HTTP API with Node.js running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework.

This template does not include any kind of persistence (database). In this project we will create an AWS cloud infrastructure with API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda and AWS CloudFormation using the Serverless framework for development based on Infrastructure as a Code.<br></br>

## Usage

Prerequisites:

*  have an AWS account and install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)**  on the machine.
* Install the **[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)**<br></br>

## Initial Setup

### AWS Credentials
* Create user: AWS Management Console -> IAM Dashboard -> Create New User -> "username" -> Permissions "Administrator Access" -> Programmatic Access -> Dowload Keys
* In terminal: ```$ aws configure``` -> paste previously generated credentials

### Configure the Serverless framework
```$ npm i -g serverless```


### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-http-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-http-api-project-dev (152s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-node-http-api-project-dev-hello (1.9 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v2.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "input": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": \"\"\n}"
}
```


Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
